# Choreo-AI
I am working on a research project named as Choreo AI - Real-Time Dance generation from Music using RNN. Everyone likes to dance, but not everyone can dance, This Project / Application is what makes you see yourself dancing for different songs. Dance moves are swapped whenever there is a beat in music.  Dance moves are generated based on acoustic features extracted from music. This product has various applications in the field of virtual reality and in the entertainment sector.  This application can be an alternative for an app like MX Player, where you see a blank screen while listening to the audio, here this feature displays a dance generated for that particular song  As a final product, you will see an application where you select your song and desired dance style (Ballet, Hip-hop, kathak, etc.) then you get to see a new choreographed dance moves with a human animation.
